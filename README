Project II: Spelling Checker

For this assignment, we were able to break down the 3 components given to us:
1. Finding and opening all the specified files, including directory traversal
    -In order to properly execute this and see if a directory was included, we used a simple google search and found a stackoverflow solution
    -https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19464571/whether-a-given-file-argument-is-a-directory-or-not-c 
    -In addition to this, the lecture notes mentioned specific uses which we were able to utilize to open and read the files.

2. Reading the file and generating a sequence of position-annotated words
    -To read the file, we used the function, processTextFile which is mentioned below.

3. Checking whether a word is contained in the dictionary
    - We started by adding everything to the dictionary. To do this, we basically created an array with the space of 100k string bytes. 
We did this due to the fact that the ilab dictionary has this many words. However, if this is not enough space, it will multiply 
later on to increase to the necessary amount. We freed everything at the end of the program as this is the only thing we needed to 
allocate space for.
    - Then what we did was we had a couple of different functions that would do different things:
        - trimWord, this basically got rid of the punctuation that was either behind or in front of the word that was in the text file

        - capitalizationCheck: This function made sure that if a word in the dictionary was capitalized, It would check the word to 
        see if it matched first of all, but then would also check if the word in the text file ad any extra capitalization. 
        The assignment says that this would be considered correct.

        - checkVariations: This function checks if the word exists in the dictionary using binary search. It uses the 
        capitalizationCheck to return true or false to its call.

        - processBuffer: Simply put, this function checks each word in the text file and uses checkVariations

        - processTextFile: This function calls processBuffer and properly checks with dictionary

        - processWordComponenet: This function checks each component of a hyphenated word to see if it matches with the dictionary

        - processHyphenatedWord: This function utilizes processWordComponent to fully match the whole entire word with the 
        dictionary and returns if it is a valid word or not

    - In order to find the word in the dictionary, we used binary search to efficiently find the word. We can see that 
    this is O(logn) which isn't too slow and the program executes fast enough regardless. When using the ilab dictionary,
    it seems to take around half a second to load and display the outputs or the spelling errors. However, with smaller
    dictionaries, it gives the output instantly.


To test this code, we used the following dictionary: (dict1.txt)
hello
MacDonald
Hyphenated
moMent
Tester's

With the test file containing: (test1.txt)
Hello HellO
hello
HELLO
HelLo
MacDonald
'macDonald.
MACDONALD
macdonald
MACDonald 
MAcDonald
HYPHEN-ATED
Hyphenated
MACDONAld
moment
MOMEnt
Moment 
MoMENT
MoMent
MOMENT
Testers
TESTERs
testers 
tESTERs 
123hello
12hello232
12MacDonalD123
321macDonald123
TESter's 
Tester's
Hyphenated-hello
HYPHENATED-HELLO
Hyphenated-Hello
HYphenated-Hello

With this information, the program reported:
test1.txt (1,7): HellO
test1.txt (4,1): HelLo
test1.txt (6,2): macDonald
test1.txt (8,1): macdonald
test1.txt (9,1): MACDonald
test1.txt (10,1): MAcDonald
test1.txt (11,1): HYPHEN-ATED
test1.txt (13,1): MACDONAld
test1.txt (14,1): moment
test1.txt (15,1): MOMEnt
test1.txt (17,1): MoMENT
test1.txt (18,1): MoMent
test1.txt (20,1): Testers
test1.txt (21,1): TESTERs
test1.txt (22,1): testers
test1.txt (23,1): tESTERs
test1.txt (26,1): MacDonalD
test1.txt (27,1): macDonald
test1.txt (28,1): TESter's
test1.txt (33,1): HYphenated-Hello

Clearly, it reports all the correct information. We were unclear if the apostrophes from words like Tester’s 
needed to be removed because in the assignment details it says that it doesn’t need to be noticed and should 
be a separate word in the dictionary than Testers. We only removed trailing punctuation from the text file.

The reason we used this test waas because it allows us to tackle a couple of different scenarios. For example, 
it was able to detect the punctuation and trim it and still report whether or not it was wrong or not. Also, 
the apostrophe as mentioned before still outputs properly. If the word is spelled incorrectly or if the 
capitalization is incorrect, it will report it incorrectly. In addition to this, we used the hyphen and 
it seems to report properly. We were unclear as to the directions with this but we implemented it to the best 
of our ability.


The next textfile and dictionary we used was: (dict2.txt) (test2.txt)

Dictionary:
apple
Rutgers
NSA
fooBar
aBc 

Text File: 
apple Apple aPple APPLE 
rutgers RUTGers RUTGERS Rutgers 
nSa NSA Nsa 
foobar FooBAR FOOBAR Foobar 
aBc ABc ABC abc abC aBC Abc AbC


Output:
test2.txt (1,13): aPple
test2.txt (2,1): rutgers
test2.txt (2,9): RUTGers
test2.txt (3,1): nSa
test2.txt (4,1): foobar
test2.txt (4,8): FooBAR
test2.txt (5,5): ABc
test2.txt (5,13): abc
test2.txt (5,17): abC
test2.txt (5,21): aBC
test2.txt (5,29): AbC

The reason we used this test scenario was because it came from the lecture notes. The reason we did 
this was because we can see exactly if it outputs correctly because we are basically given the 
answers in the lecture notes. Also, we were able to test if it properly outputs when there are 
multiple words in one line. Clearly, the output displays the character at which it was reported 
which shows exactly where the incorrect word is coming from. The main reason for this scenario 
was to check the capitalization as aBc was initially giving us issues. However, we were able to 
fix it and now receive the proper output.


Lastly, we used a directory with many different files. We had a directory which had multiple 
different text files and even another directory. We were able to see this as the output:

./spchk dict1.txt test2.txt testholder test1.txt
test2.txt (1,1): apple
test2.txt (1,7): Apple
test2.txt (1,13): aPple
test2.txt (1,19): APPLE
test2.txt (2,1): rutgers
test2.txt (2,9): RUTGers
test2.txt (2,17): RUTGERS

test1.txt (18,1): MoMent
test1.txt (20,1): Testers
test1.txt (21,1): TESTERs
test1.txt (22,1): testers
test1.txt (23,1): tESTERs
test1.txt (26,1): MacDonalD
test1.txt (27,1): macDonald
test1.txt (28,1): TESter's
test1.txt (33,1): HYphenated-Hello

Through this, we can see that it was able to open each and every file whether it was in a directory or by itself. 
On top of this, we had files inside of these directories that would start with ‘.’. However, these files were 
skipped as it was mentioned in the assignment details. There are plenty of test files inside this folder and
the code can handle it properly and move onto the next file when it has found any issue or it has completed
reading the current file.

One last thing, This is the output with the large ilab file:
./spchk /usr/share/dict/words  test2.txt testholder test1.txt
test2.txt (1,13): aPple
test2.txt (2,1): rutgers
test2.txt (2,9): RUTGers
test2.txt (3,1): nSa
test2.txt (4,8): FooBAR
test2.txt (5,1): aBc
test2.txt (5,5): ABc
test2.txt (5,13): abc
test2.txt (5,17): abC
test2.txt (5,21): aBC
test2.txt (5,29): AbC
testholder/notSkip2.txt (1,1): ashdjfa
testholder/notSkip2.txt (2,3): shfds
testholder/notSkip2.txt (3,1): asdfihas
testholder/folderinfold/notSkip1.txt (2,1): aldjfh
test1.txt (1,7): HellO
test1.txt (4,1): HelLo
test1.txt (6,2): macDonald
test1.txt (8,1): macdonald
test1.txt (9,1): MACDonald
test1.txt (10,1): MAcDonald
test1.txt (11,1): HYPHEN-ATED

test1.txt (17,1): MoMENT
test1.txt (18,1): MoMent
test1.txt (21,1): TESTERs
test1.txt (23,1): tESTERs
test1.txt (26,1): MacDonalD
test1.txt (27,1): macDonald
test1.txt (28,1): TESter's
test1.txt (33,1): HYphenated-Hello

Just for fun we also tested the dictionary with itself and received:
ydp11@butter:~/systems/P2$ ./spchk dict1.txt dict1.txt
ydp11@butter:~/systems/P2$ ./spchk dict2.txt dict2.txt
Both with EXIT_SUCCESS
